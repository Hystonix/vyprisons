# ~~~ Offsets ~~~
# Offsets are positions that are relative to the origin of the schematic
# The origin of the schematic is typically where you are when the schematic is pasted with WorldEdit,
#
# So if you want the player to spawn 3 blocks in the positive x direction from where you are when the schematic is placed,
# the spawn offset will be 3,0,0
spawn_offset: 0,0,0

# The mine region points are two points that define the cuboid zone where blocks are placed,
# It can be any 2 diagonal (on both planes) corners on the cuboid
# But it's probably best to keep one with the minimum and one with the maximum

mine_region_b_offset: 30,0,30

# The bounding region is the region where the player is allowed to be,
# By default, those with permission node vyprison.bypass.bounds can bypass the restriction,
# but others are tp'd back to the spawn if they leave the area
#
# Just to make sure, consider surrounding your mine with barrier blocks
# and use this only as a backup plan
